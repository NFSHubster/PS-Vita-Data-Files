Hi there !

If you'd like to contribute to this repository by adding more games,simply add the game's name,thumbnail's link,and download link in the following format inside the "const games" block
    
    {
      name: "Game's Name",
      image:
        "Thumbnail's link",
      link: "Download Link to the Game",
    },

To edit a game's thumbnail,simply replace the thumbnail link of the title.
